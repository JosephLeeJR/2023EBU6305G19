						<p>What is eighteen stairs?
						</p>
						<p>
							Shibati is not unfamiliar to locals. As a corridor connecting the upper and lower half of the city, Shibati has been one of Chongqing's best-preserved connecting passages for nearly a thousand years, and it once occupied a very important position in history. Eighteen Stairs starts from Houci Street in the south to Jiaochangkou in the north. Eighteen stairs is not only eighteen stone stairs.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the Ming and Qing Dynasties, it was located on a long slope, where residents built their homes against the mountains. It is said that there was a local well, and the nearby residents ate the water from the well. The well was divided into 18 layers of stone stairs because it was more than 200 years away from the residents' homes, so it was named eighteen Ladder.
						</p>
						<p>
							Eighteen Ladder after five years of transformation and upgrading, the level of appearance has also risen to a great extent. At the same time, while preserving the traditional mountain city style, wooden shops are arranged in the street. In the evening, when the lights are bright, the whole Shibaiti becomes a night market of lights, which echoes with the lights of the surrounding families, showing a school of fireworks, and the vision and soul are cured by this scene.
						</p>
						<p>
							In Shibati, you can visit the Shancheng Memory Museum, which displays a large number of rare books and videos of old Chongqing, and is a must for learning about the history of Chongqing.
							The Shibati Grand Tunnel Site Memorial Hall is a heavy historical memory for Chongqing people. You can go here to feel the "memory of Chongqing in the bomb shelter". Through the iron gate, prying into the Chongqing eighty or ninety years ago experienced pain, feel those "more and more strong" years of war.

						</p>
						<p>
							You can go to Zhu Bingren Art Museum and experience the magnificent copper carving art in the 1000-square-meter immersive copper art space. Every brick, tile, table and chair are all made of copper, showing the strong characteristics of Hui style architecture of Ming and Qing Dynasties.
						</p>
						<p>
							There is also a special travel-themed bookstore: Si Shu Â· Travel Space. The whole bookstore is on the fourth floor, full of modern sense, theme reading area, afternoon tea area, parent-child reading area, outdoor sports area and so on. Each area is full of atmosphere, which is especially suitable for parents to play and punch in!

						<a href="#">On the side of the wall there was a huge stone, like an elephant, named White Elephant</a>
						<p>Chongqing's net celebrity attractions in the end how many? Objectively speaking, you can't count on ten fingers. If you have enough time at your fingertips, you can live in this city for at least a week, eating and drinking, walking through the streets and feeling the fireworks of the mountain city.</p>
						<p>The most popular Internet attractions in Chongqing are in Yuzhong District, the mother city. Compared with Hongya Cave, Chaotianmen and other traditional scenic spots, the western style of White Elephant Street gives people a bright feeling.</p>
						<p>White Elephant Street, located between Wanglongmen and Taipingmen in Yuzhong District of Chongqing, was a cultural center as early as the Southern Song Dynasty. During the period of Chunyou in the Southern Song Dynasty, Yu Wangjie, the governor of Chongqing, opened a recruitment hall here to offer advice on the anti-Mongolia plan. What many people don't know is that the first rich telegraph office in Chongqing opened on Baixiang Street.
							When Chongqing opened its port in 1891, there were many foreign banks and financial institutions along White Elephant Street, comparable in size and influence to the Bund of Shanghai and the Thirteen Banks of Guangzhou.</p>
						<p>At that time, White Elephant Street was a "celebrity district" in Chongqing. The hosts and writers of different newspapers lived here, and Chen Yi and Lao She also left their footprints.
							Many old buildings from the early days of the port are preserved here, which combine Chinese and Western characteristics in style and are a kind of eclectic architecture. In addition, Baixiang Street also has some typical stilted houses and Baroque style houses. Even the private Xinghua Primary School, which was built in 1953, is eclectic in style. The former Chongqing Introspect School, built in 1930, used to be the Shanxi Merchants Hall earlier. The so-called Shanxi Business Hall is simply the headquarters of Shanxi Chamber of Commerce. From this perspective, it can be seen that Chongqing had high commercial development potential long ago. The city's biggest advantage is to guard the intersection of Yangtze River and Jialing River.</p>
						<p>White Elephant Street is composed of several streets crisscrossing, and the buildings are mostly made of black brick as the main building material.
							Compared to other Internet celebrity neighborhoods, Baixiang Street is relatively quiet, and its stylish architecture makes it a haven for photography lovers, as well as newlyweds and tone-sensitive bloggers. Relatively speaking, White Elephant Street is more attractive to female tourists than male tourists, because female tourists prefer to take portraits, while male tourists stroll around more. In White Elephant Street, it is easy to take photos of the retro style and literary style, wearing fashionable clothes, Qing Dynasty clothes and clothes of the early Republic of China, and the scenery is very good.</p>
